## Project Description

<!-- Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality. -->

The frontend of my project is an app/web page for one of my favorite fruit tea/smoothie shop in my area.  Since they don't have a proper fully english website or app to base on, I'll be creating my own by using the chinese site and the shops design astetics as inspiration.  The app will have a home page that show images of their top drinks and provide provide the location informations and hours of their shops.  It will also have a menu page that list out all the drink items and when clicked it will link to the drink info page where you can select drink sizes, ice level, sugar level, and what toppings you would like and then add to cart.  There will be acheckout page which will allow you to see the items in your cart and then checkout.  There will also be a page for drink picks of the week and month.

For the post-mvp I will look to add a signup/login option and page.  To go along with that would be a profile page.


## Wireframes/Time-Priority Matrix/Recat Architecture

<!-- Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app. -->

### MVP/PostMVP

<!-- The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.   -->

#### MVP
- Learn Python/Django.
- Test creating a backend with Python/Django.
- Create backend using Python/Django
- Create a multipage app with a home, menu, drink and cart page
- Menu page allows user to see and select a drink

- Add model and controller for signup/login
- Add model and controller for cart items

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull | 
| Header | This will render the header and include the nav | 
| Main | This will include the react router and switch |
| Home | This will be the home page |
| Menu | Page to list out all the drinks and links to the Drink page|
| Drink | Page to show drink info, adjust certain criterias of the drink and add to cart |
| Cart | Page to show drinks added to cart and checkout |
| Signup | A post-mvp page for signing up |
| Login | A post-mvp page for logging in|
| Profile | A post-mvp page for user profile |
| Footer | This will render the footer | 


<!-- Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize. -->
